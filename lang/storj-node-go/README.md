# storj-node
> implemented in Go

This is an experiment to implement a storj node in Go and explore the language features, possible frameworks, persistence layers, and the general Go ecosystem for use in our next iteration.

## Goals

- Spec out the full skeleton of API endpoints as per the [Spec draft](../../docs/spec-draft.md)
- Package a binary
- Build and dockerize the server and create a workflow for it
- Document any pros and cons and our experience with Go overall
